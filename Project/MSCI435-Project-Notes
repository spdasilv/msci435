Modelling
	1 - variables (ex: binary variable that has one course, one prof one classroom is the most basic, but the problem will grow too big)
	2 - Objective function (ex: min total cost - different type of rooms are more expensive, different resources like labs and classrooms...) (ex: how satisfied the students and the professors are... breaks and lunch)
	3 - Constraints (ex: courses can't be taught by the same prof at the same time. want the mult sections to be at the same time or sections need to be at different times, how many consecutive hours are required for a given course...)
